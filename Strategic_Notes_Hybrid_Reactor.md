# Strategic Notes: Hybrid Nuclear Radiation Core

## Purpose
Enable decentralized, long-term energy modules using isotope emissions from reprocessed nuclear waste. Support critical infrastructure, space missions, or modular backup for SMRs.

## Advantages
- Fully passive: no fuel, pumps, or coolant
- Resistant to EMP, tampering, external disruptions
- Modular, scalable from 10 W to multiple kW
- Deployable in hardened military or extraterrestrial installations

## Policy Implications
- Helps address backlog of spent fuel reprocessing
- Reduces need for frequent refueling or replacement logistics
- Offers NATO/EU/international bodies hardened energy option

## Limitations
- High initial cost
- Requires strict containment and licensing
- Not suitable for public-grid-scale output
