# Hybrid Nuclear Core: Œ±/Œ≤/Œ≥ Multi-Isotopic Reactor Module

An open-source conceptual design for a long-life hybrid radiation module combining alpha (Œ±), beta (Œ≤), and gamma (Œ≥) isotopes, extracted from spent nuclear fuel. The system is designed for embedded operation alongside subcritical reactors, SMRs, or isolated infrastructure nodes.

Dear colleagues,

We share this open-source hybrid nuclear energy concept combining isotopic Œ±/Œ≤/Œ≥ layers extracted from spent fuel. This design aims to enable ultra-long-lived passive energy sources, support for subcritical reactor activation, and neutron-assisted infrastructure with zero maintenance.
