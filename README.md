# Hybrid-Nuclear-Core-Multi-Isotopic-Reactor-Module
An open-source conceptual design for a long-life hybrid radiation core combining alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) isotopes extracted from used nuclear fuel. Optimized for integration with small modular reactors (SMRs), subcritical ADS systems, and off-grid infrastructure.
